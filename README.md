Expected Time to Crack a Password
=================================

This repository contains a Python script that displays the **estimated** time required to crack a password of various lengths via brute force. It assumes passwords that are generated randomly using dice rolls, a deck of cards, and dictionary words. This was created as a tool to show the importance of creating longer passwords during my research in the Computer Science Department at the University of Virginia.

The goal of the research was to create educational materials to teach basic cybersecurity to high school students. See www.suretysecurity.org for more information from our research.

Note: this is the maximum estimated time, if the hacker is using brute force to try passwords. There's always the **incredibly rare, yet unfortunate** chance that a password is cracked randomly on the first try!
